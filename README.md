# FomanticUI-Swift

This repo contains the
[Fomantic-UI](https://github.com/fomantic/fomantic-ui)
CSS distribution, packaged up as Swift Package Manager project.

Since the Swift Package Manager did not used to be able to with resource files,
this is a more convenient way to directly embed common resources
within your application.
It is pretty big though :-)
