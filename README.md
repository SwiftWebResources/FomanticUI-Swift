# SemanticUI-Swift

This repo contains the
[Semantic UI](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI)
CSS distribution, packaged up as Swift Package Manager project.

Since the Swift Package Manager cannot yet deal with resource files,
this is a more convenient way to directly embed common resources
within your application.
It is pretty big though :-)
